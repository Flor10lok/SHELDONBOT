# SHELDONBOT ðŸ¤–
Free auto answer and tweak menu for Edgenuity, developed by Tqrtle, Defy (De-y), and Gradyn Wursten

# How to download and install
Go to releases on the right hand side, click on whichever desired version, and click on the file that ends with ".js" to download the file. Then go into tampermonkey, click the plus icon or the "Create new script" button and drag the sheldonbot-WHATEVERVERSIONYOUHAVE.js file into tampermonkey, and hit the button that says "install" (if it says "reinstall" you might already have the script) then you're finished!

# Discord
Feel free to [join the discord server here](https://discord.gg/9WCJEcFDXt), but keep in mind it's purely for updates. **(DO NOT DM ME OR ANY DEVS FOR HELP)**

# Why were all the channels on the discord server deleted?
Because running a discord for a edgenuity script is extremely hard, there's lots of drama and toxicity, so I decided to only leave the discord up for purely announcements/updates.
Please don't DM me or any of the devs for help we used to be open to help anyone but it's just way too much to deal with, if you need help DM the people with support role.

This script is a fork and ONLY includes the menu (developed by Defy), auto-submit (developed by Tqrtle), and auto-answer (answer IDs sourced from [TQRTLE'S GITHUB](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/turtlecod/ids/main/4)) none of these features involve me and the developers have these scripts public on their own pages as well.
